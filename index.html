      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The web is a group of computers that communicate with each other. 
          When a person goes to a web page like <a href="www.google.com">www.google.com</a>, their computer sends a 
          <span class="italic">HTTP Request</span> to 
          a <span class="italic">server</span>. 
        </p>
         <p>
        The server then finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where
        a <span class="italic">web browser</span> interprets the page and displays it
        on the user's screen.

        does a good job of explaining more.

        Many types of files can be found on the wed including plain text, HTML, images, videos, music, etc.

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
         HTML stands for <span class="italic">Hypertext Markup Language.</span> This language was invented in the 1990's and is the
        main type of document on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
        HTML documents contain <span class="italic">text content</span> which describes
        "what you see" and <span class="italic">markup</span> which describes "how it
        looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">This video</a>

          </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
      HTML documents and markup are made up of <span class="bold">elements</span>. An HTML element
      refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.  Tags can <span class="bold">bold</span>, 
      <em>italicize</em>, link words or phrases to web pages, images, videos, etc. (with anchor tags), start new paragraphs, and insert images and videos
      directly to your web page.  Some tags known as Void tags do not require closing tags.  Types of void tags 
      include image and breakage tags.  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
        explains the distinction well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attributes are properties of HTML elements that provide additional information.
          These attributes are linked back to CSS and other programming languages to 
          create style to HTML.

            Why Computers are Stupid
          </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
          Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. A small 
          typo or leaving out an end tag can create big problems as computers don't 
          look at the screen and go "oh, that's the problem!".  Programmers have to be careful and literal
          with computers to ensure computers interpret our instructions correctly.

            Inline vs. Block Elements
          </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
          HTML elements are either <span class="bold">inline</span> 
          or <span class="bold">block</span>. Block elements form an "invisible box" 
          around the content inside of them.  Span is an inline element and div is a 
          block element.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Span_and_div">This web page</a> explains the difference
          between span (inline) and div (block) elements well.

        <p>
         HTML elements have elements inside of each other.  You can plan these elements
         out similar to a "family tree".  Web pages are set up in boxes and like a
         family tree, these boxes have boxes inside of them, and boxes inside of those
         boxes, and so on.

            The Relationship between Indented HTML and Boxes
          </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
         HTML documents are indented to show the box structure of the document.  
         When you read or write HTML code it is indented to illustrate the corresponding
         box in each section of the page.

            Text Editors (for Programming)
          </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
         Text editors are used to help programmers work faster and with less 
         repetition. Special text editors like Scratchpad and Sublime Text automatically
         generate closing tags or quotation marks to help the programmer move quicker
         and avoid costly time mistakes. 
         </p>
          <p>
            Codepen is another editor which allows programmers to use HTML, CSS, and Java languages.  It does not auto populate closing tags or quotation marks but Codepen provides a simultaneous mock up on the programmer's work.

              <p>
                Avoiding repetition is essential.  When programmers <span class="bold">don't</span> avoid repetition
                we leave the door open for errors.  Using CSS to avoid repetition allows us to change entire groups 
                of "classes" all at once instead of individually which can open the door for mistakes,
              </p>
              <p>
              Imagine having 10 or more words bolded in on your web page.  If you used the b tag for bold throughout the code
              and then your client decided they wanted the bold changed to italics, you would have to individually 
              change those b tags to em tags.  With CSS, writing code with class elements allows you to make the change
              all at one time and avoid time consuming mistakes.

            <div class="concept-description">
            <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it adds style to web pages. Like the tree like structure
            of HTML, CSS uses a similar type of family tree through inheritance to cascade the properties from a
            specific element to other elements in the same family tree.
            </p>
            <p>
              CSS provides all the styles such as font, color, border, padding, positioning, alignment, spacing, 
              box sizing, etc. to a webpage.  CSS gives your web page its swagger!  Websites like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">
                CSS Reference</a> list standard CSS properties, rules, etc. in alphabetical order to assist programmers
                in locating information quickly and accurately.

              Box Sizing and Positioning
            </div>
            <p>
              HTML elements are boxes.  Each box has four components (margins, borders, padding, and content).  When
              creating a webpage it can be difficult to get the size of the box right due to all the box components. 
              There are two techniques to help with sizing.  The first is using percentages instead of pixels and the
              second is setting the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.  These techniques allow
              the programmer to get the box sizing right.
            </p>
            <p>
             Because divs are block elements they take up the entire width of a page.  A good way to allow them to 
             sit side-by-side on a web page is to use Flexboxes.  Using the rule <span class="bold">display: flex;</span> in CSS will put the
             boxes next to each other to create flexibility in designing your web page.
